# versa Big Bang Challenge

Name : Muhamad Dhiyaulhaq bin Md Kamarudin

Problem:
There was a tale when 2 prime numbers collided and a big bang happened. Scientists found out
the 2 prime numbers are 3 and 5 but they need a model to generate an array of numbers to
predict when the big bang will happen again.

Solution:
Create a script to iterate through 1 to 100 and replace any number divisible by 3 with the word
BIG number divisible by 5 with the word BANG. If the number is divisible by 3 and 5, replace it
with BIG BANG. Generate the array and output to ‘output.json’ file with result as follow:
[“1”, “2”, “BIG”, “4”, “BANG”, “BIG”, “7”, “8”, “BIG”, “BANG”, “11”, “BIG”, “13”, “14”, “BIGBANG”,
.... all the way to 100]


Answer:
1. I use Python programming language on Spyder platform for this challenge
2. The code of the solution can be found on 'bigbang_challenge.py' file
3. Run the code and the output would be overwrite on 'output.json' file
4. The 'output.json' file can be open on Notepad
5. We can also double check the output with the code in 'open_output.py' file
6. Run the code in 'open_output.py' and the output will appear on the console
